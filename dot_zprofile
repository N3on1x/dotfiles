# To make Homebrew's completions available in zsh, you mus get the
# Homebrew-managed zsh site-functions on your FPATH before initialising zsh's
# completion facility. 
# Note: If you are using Oh My Zsh, it will call compinit for you, so this must
# be done before you call oh-my-zsh.sh. This may be done by appending the
# following line to your ~/.zprofile after Homebrew's initialization:
# Reference:

#FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:$FPATH

# To make pyenv work in non-interactive shells
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

# Set prefered editor
export EDITOR='vi -e'
export VISUAL='/usr/local/bin/nvim --listen /tmp/nvimsocket'
