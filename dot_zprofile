# To make Homebrew's completions available in zsh, you mus get the
# Homebrew-managed zsh site-functions on your FPATH before initialising zsh's
# completion facility.
# Note: If you are using Oh My Zsh, it will call compinit for you, so this must
# be done before you call oh-my-zsh.sh. This may be done by appending the
# following line to your ~/.zprofile after Homebrew's initialization:
# Reference:
# https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-zsh
FPATH=$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:$FPATH

# Evaluate Homebrew export statments. See `brew help shellenv`
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv zsh)

# To make pyenv work in non-interactive shells
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
# Oh-my-zsh plugin 'pyenv' is responsible for loading autocompletion and
# pyenv-virtualenv

# Set prefered editor
export EDITOR='vi -e'
export VISUAL='/usr/local/bin/nvim --listen /tmp/nvimsocket'
